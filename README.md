# Random Forest DDoS Attack Classifier
### This project implements a Random Forest-based machine learning model to detect and classify DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using network traffic data.
It uses SMOTE to handle class imbalance, extracts important features, and provides evaluation metrics including confusion matrices and feature importance visualization.
